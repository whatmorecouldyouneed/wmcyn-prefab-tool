## üöÄ what is it

`wmcyn-prefab-tool` is an internal command line utility built for authorized developers working within the **whatmorecouldyouneed** organization.

it lets you spin up fully functional, deployment-ready web or mobile projects with just a few prompts. it's like having a jumpstart button for drops, sites, campaigns, and creative ideas.

every project created with this tool:

- lives in the official **wmcyn** github org
- supports **next.js (app router)**, **react native**, or **vanilla html/css**
- deploys automatically via **github actions**
- includes **firebase** mailing list functionality
- optionally integrates **shopify** for storefronts
- optionally wires up **dns** / domain config
- optionally includes **jest** + **react testing library** setup
- ships with a clean `/` homepage and optional `/shop`

## üîê who can use this

this tool is **only for developers with write access** to the `whatmorecouldyouneed` github org.

you'll be prompted to authorize your github account. if you're not in the org, it won't let you scaffold anything.

- access to the whatmorecouldyouneed github organization

- a firebase project (for mailing list + auth)

- shopify storefront api credentials (if using shopify)

- optional domain or dns provider details

- preconfigured github actions workflow  
- support for `next export` + github pages deploy (via `gh-pages` branch)  
- optional jest + react testing library setup with example tests

## üö¢ deployment

the generated project includes a working deploy pipeline via github actions:

- installs deps  
- injects firebase + shopify secrets from the github repo

you'll need to set your secrets manually in github before deploying.
